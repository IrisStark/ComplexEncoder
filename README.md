# ComplexEncoder
This class intended to convert nominal variables to complex numbers in a way descibed in the paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1601.01966.pdf
Numerical Coding of Nominal Data by Zenon Gniazdowski and Micha≈Ç Grabowski.
This way nominal variables can be used along with continuous, which is helpful for the kind of algortihms which designed only
for continuous features like k-means.
